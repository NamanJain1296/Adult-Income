# Adult-Income
The Adult Income dataset is a collection of demographic and financial attributes of individuals, with the goal of predicting whether an individual earns more than $50,000 per year. This dataset serves as a benchmark for testing and evaluating various classification algorithms.

# Dataset Overview
The dataset includes features such as age, education level, marital status, occupation, and more. The target variable is binary, indicating whether an individual's income exceeds $50,000 or not. This makes it suitable for binary classification tasks.

# Algorithms Tested
This dataset has been used to evaluate the performance of several classification algorithms, including:

Logistic Regression: A widely used linear model for binary classification tasks.
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classification: A non-parametric algorithm that classifies an individual based on the majority class of its k-nearest neighbors.
Support Vector Machines (SVM): A powerful algorithm for both linear and non-linear classification tasks.
Decision Tree: A tree-like model that partitions the dataset into subsets based on the most significant attributes.

# Usage
Researchers and machine learning practitioners can leverage this dataset to assess the strengths and weaknesses of different classification algorithms. It provides an opportunity to compare the accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score of each algorithm on this specific classification task.
